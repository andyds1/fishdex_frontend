## Setup - You'll need your own backend service for this, or you can enjoy the mockdata provided in the frontend.

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/andyds1/fishdex_frontend_htf2025.git
cd fishdex-frontend
```

2. Configure API endpoint in `assets/js/fetcher.js`:
#### If you really want to build your own backend, have a look at the fetcher.js file. This will give you a lot of info about the api endpoints you need. GL & HF!
```javascript
const API_BASE_URL = 'http://your-backend-url.com/api';
```

3. Serve with a local server (required for ES6 modules):
```bash
# Option 1: Python
python -m http.server 8000

# Option 2: Node.js
npx http-server

# Option 3: VS Code Live Server extension
```

4. Open in browser:
```
http://localhost:8000/fishdex-home.html
```

## API Integration

The app expects the backend API to return responses in this format:
```javascript
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Fish found for device",
  "data": [
    {
      "fish": {
        "_id": "...",
        "name": "Clownfish",
        "family": "Pomacentridae",
        "waterType": "Saltwater",
        // ... other fish data
      },
      "imageUrl": "http://...",
      "timestamp": "2025-11-12T13:27:27.913Z",
      "fishId": "..."
    }
  ]
}
```
